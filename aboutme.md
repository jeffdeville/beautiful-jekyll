# Overview
My entrepreneurial experience, excellent communication skills, and natural technical inclination have allowed me to excel at every level of a technical organization. Iâ€™m equally comfortable strategizing with the business, architecting solutions, managing teams, writing software in numerous languages, and administrating infrastructure.

I work hard, learn rabidly, and love every second of it.

ConnectDER

ConnectDER creates a physical collar that snaps onto your power meter. (That round part w/ the screen in front). This collar makes it cheaper and easier to augment your homes energy from solar panels. But it also both tracks solar power production, and provides an API with which to control it.

I was the only developer, and my responsibilities included the coding, devops, and security for the following:

API adapting an intricate and arcane messaging protocol (SunSpec) to permit query and alteration of solar inverters with 99.9% availability.
Multi-tenant website for collar/data management.
Internal apis for collar firmware, parameter updates

Given the scope of responsibility, and that I was the only developer, a substantial part of my contribution involved finding the lowest maintenance, automatable solutions to business problems.

Media Client

Details confidential, but it has a very heavily distributed application architecture based on message passing, numerous 3rd party integrations, including NLP & NLG services.

Technologies:
Ruby 2.1, Rails 4.2, RabbitMQ, Postgresql

Thrive

I joined the dev team for this startup, and worked to amplify the productivity of the team by fixing their CI issues, driving them to adopt some more stringent coding practices, set more realistic client expectations. I also helped and manage several team members to clean up areas of the code that had resisted previous attempts at refactoring. Contributed extra effort to push through a tight deadline for an investor presentation.

Technologies:
Ruby 2.1, Rails 4.2, Postresql, AWS (EC2, ELB, Route53), Capistrano, React, Reflux & Redux, rspec

SungardAS V2

The Client decided to swap shift from CloudStack to OpenStack (from V1 project). This time we decided to augment OpenStack's existing Django platform instead of replacing the UI entirely. We had to bolt on new components, and heavily alter existing ones to include pricing, as well as augment the security model in ways OpenStack was not designed to provide (multi-tenancy).

Technologies:

OpenStack, Python 2.7, Django 1.7, MySQL, Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, CloudFormation, CircleCI, git, Heroku, Continuous Integration, Bash, Make, Red Hat, AWS, Javascript (ES5/6), Karma, Mocha, Babel

SungardAS V1

Built a new UI for the CloudStack cloud management platform with much finer grained control over security (multi-tenant). Required integration with numerous internal systems and teams. Established a metadata-driven, aggregated logging server. Also built a few backend system components.

Technologies:
Cloudstack, Ruby 2.1, Rails 4, Golang, NodeJS, BackboneJS, Omniauth, RESTful services, SOAP services, Make, Graylog
